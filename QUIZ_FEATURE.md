## How to Replace with Real Quiz

### Step 1: Create Quiz API/Socket Events

**Backend (`server/src/controllers/socketController.js`):**
```javascript
// Add quiz events
socket.on('quiz-start', (data) => {
  // Load quiz questions from database
  // Send questions to room
  io.to(data.roomId).emit('quiz-questions', questions);
});

socket.on('quiz-answer', (data) => {
  // Validate answer
  // Update score
  // Broadcast to room
  io.to(data.roomId).emit('quiz-score-update', scores);
});
```

### Step 2: Create Quiz Database Schema

**MongoDB Model (`server/src/models/Quiz.js`):**
```javascript
const quizSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  subject: String,
  questions: [{
    id: String,
    question: String,
    options: [String],
    correctAnswer: Number,
    points: { type: Number, default: 10 }
  }],
  createdBy: String,
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});
```

### Step 3: Update Quiz Component

Replace the placeholder data fetch:

```typescript
// In Quiz.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Fetch real quiz questions
  fetch(`${API_URL}/api/quizzes/${quizId}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setQuestions(data.questions));
}, [quizId]);

// Or use socket events
useEffect(() => {
  socket.on('quiz-questions', (questions) => {
    setQuestions(questions);
  });
  
  return () => {
    socket.off('quiz-questions');
  };
}, []);
```

### Step 4: Connect to Leaderboard

Update the `onSubmitAnswer` callback to emit points:

```typescript
<Quiz
  onSubmitAnswer={(questionId, answer) => {
    socket.emit('quiz-answer', {
      roomId,
      userId,
      questionId,
      answer,
    });
  }}
/>
```
